- A DeepL API key ([How to get one](https://support.deepl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020695820-Authentication-Key))

## Installation

## Configuration

When you first run the bot, you'll need to:

1. Choose "New bot/config" when prompted
2. Enter a name for your configuration
3. Input your Discord bot token
4. Input your DeepL API key

The bot will verify both keys and save your configuration for future use.

## Usage

### Slash Command Translation
Use the `/trsend` command with the following parameters:
- `message`: The text you want to translate
- `language`: The target language (with autocompletion support)

Example:
```
/trsend message:Asha is an happy fox language:French
```

### Flag Reaction Translation
1. React to any message with a country flag emoji
2. The bot will send you a DM containing:
   - The original message
   - The translation
   - The translator used (DeepL or Google Translate)

## Multiple Bot Configurations

You can set up multiple bot configurations by:
1. Running `start_bot.bat`
2. Selecting "New bot/config"
3. Following the setup process for each new configuration

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check if all prerequisites are installed
2. Verify your bot token and DeepL API key are valid
3. Ensure your bot has proper permissions in Discord
4. Check the logs folder for detailed error messages

## Logs
